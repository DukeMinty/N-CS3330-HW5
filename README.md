The way at which to run the file is through first hitting the run button to which you will be giving an input statement to create a new Pizza using 1 or 2 for Quitting. 
By clicking 1 you then will be prompted with creating a pizza and which type 1-4 for each type of pizza. 
Once clicking the pizza you want you will then pick which way you will like the pizza cooked which you input 1,2,or 3 based on the parallel cooking type. 
After this order information will be printed including toppings, price without toppings, total price, cooking price, pizza order id, and cooking strategy. 
Dependencies of the program include the user correctly inputting the correct integer correlating to their choice, objects, methods, variables are properly associated to their type value and are able to calculate their methods correctly, and the calling methods in the main are correctly inputted and contain value types associated with the type requested.
